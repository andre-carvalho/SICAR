## How to run with Docker?

To generate docker image
```sh
# using the docker build script
./docker-build.sh
```

To view or change the list of states, go to the sicar.py file and search for "__states"

Run to download all data from a hardcoded state list to a external directory.
Make an external directory to store the downloaded data, /my/local/data/dir, and use a volume parameter in the run command to point to it.
```sh
# run the docker image in detached mode
docker run -d --rm -v /my/local/data/dir:/data softwarevale/download-sicar:vx.y
```

### Redefine state list

You can use the list of states from the environment or, by default, from the hardcode.

To run using the custom state list, use the environment variable as follows.

```sh
docker run -d --rm -v /my/local/data/dir:/data -e STATES="AB,AC,AD" softwarevale/download-sicar:vx.y
```

### A Docker compose example

An example of car-compose.yml file content is...
```yaml
version: '2'

services:
  # for download car data
  car-task:
    image: 'softwarevale/download-sicar:vx.y.z'
    container_name: car-task
    restart: "no"
    environment:
        - STATES="AB,AC,AD"
    volumes:
      - '/main/storage/car2023:/data'
```

And to run...
```sh
docker compose -f /dir/car-compose.yml up -d
```
